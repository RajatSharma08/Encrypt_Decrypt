# Encryption and Decryption App

This is a simple web application that performs encryption and decryption using a C++ code snippet. It provides a user-friendly interface to encrypt and decrypt messages using a shift value of 5.

# Prerequisites
To run this application, you need to have the following installed on your system:
Node.js: Ensure that Node.js is installed. You can download it from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
C++ Compiler: You need a C++ compiler to compile the C++ code for encryption and decryption. The specific compiler you use may depend on your operating system.

# Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run npm install to install the required dependencies.

# Usage
Compile the C++ code using the appropriate compiler. Make sure the compiled executables (encryption and decryption) are placed in the same directory as the Node.js code.
Start the Node.js server by running node index.js or npm start.
Access the web application by opening a web browser and visiting http://localhost:3000.
Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt, and click the corresponding button.
The encrypted or decrypted message will be displayed on the screen.
